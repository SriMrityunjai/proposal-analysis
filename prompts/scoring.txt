You are an expert in RFP evaluation and proposal scoring analysis.

Extract all scoring and evaluation criteria from the following RFP text.
Focus specifically on sections that specify points, weights, or evaluation scoring (for example Section 6.6).

For each evaluation point, return the following strictly in JSON:

[
  {
    "Point": "<criterion name>",
    "Score": "<maximum score or scoring weight>",
    "EvaluationDetail": "<summary of what the proposer must demonstrate>"
  }
]

Rules:
- Output ONLY the JSON list.
- No markdown, no explanations.
- Every scoring element MUST be extracted.

RFP text:
```{rfp_text}```
